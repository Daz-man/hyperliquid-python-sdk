        If you are using an Agent/API Wallet you MUST also specify the public address of your account, not the
        address of the Agent/API Wallet.
        Otherwise, feel free to leave it blank and it will be automatically derived from the secret key. Alternatively, 
        you can specify a local `keystore_path` which will prompt you for the keystore password interactively. 
        Note: If both `secret_key` and `keystore_path` are provided, the `secret_key` will take precedence.

        You can also populate the "multi_sig" section with the secret keys of the authorized user wallets that you
        wish to sign multi-sig actions for.
